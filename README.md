- **Local First**: the entire app runs off of a JSON; sync it using anything you'd like!
- **Jot, Split, Do**: capture by appending to a text buffer; submit by splitting into subtasks
- **Dates, under control**: start time, due time, *and* schedule timeâ€”you decide when you want to do something, down to the second
- **Your tasks, your time**: one-way calendar sync + workload visualization makes sure that you are never overscheduled
- **Master your life**: powerful saved searches to filter by availability, ordering, and regular expressions

*Coming soon; currently under development*
